			<h1>Milestone 2: Website for the artist Reb Willard </h1>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Below is a proposed persona and use case for Reb Willard&#146;s web site. This site is meant to serve as

				on the the best items for which she is willing to pay more.</p>

			<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> In addition to the time Nancy spends &#147;collecting&#148; online,
				she also
				enjoys browsing for new artist and works of art. There is always room in her collection for a new piece.
				Nancy finds that many of the gallery and artist websites are not very appealing.</p>

			<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Nancy&#146;s goal is to sit down this evening with a nice glass of wine and peruse the web
				for new works of art. She has nothing specific in mind just 45 minutes of relaxing and browsing before
				dinner. Our goal is to catch her attention with Reb Willard&#146;s site, so we can capture her contact information for future communication and to increase the chaces of a future sale.</p>
