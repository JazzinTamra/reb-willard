			<h1>Milestone 3: Website for the artist Reb Willard </h1>

			<h2>Wireframes for RebWillard.com</h2>
			<p>Below are the proposed wireframes for Reb Willard&#146;s web site. I've included wireframes for the four top level pages of her site. If I need to limit the project to two pages, I would like to do the home and selected works pages. This site is meant to serve as a gallery for Reb&#146;s work to help increase her sales and establish a professional social media presence. Reb does not currently have a mailing list, so I will need to set one up from scratch.</p>
