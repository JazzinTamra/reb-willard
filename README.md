##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on Milestone 1. This is going to be a great project, and it will provide plently of opportunity to scale up in the future. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Great work.

###To Do
Only one minor fix... rename the public-html directory to: public_html. Just be mindful of that undescore.

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Great work on Milestone 2. What you have outlined is perfect for the MVP scope. Because you are creating a site that features art, you may be interested in including a gallery plugin such as [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/). It's easy to use and mobile friendly. Does Reb already have a mailing list set up, or would you need to set one up from scratch?

Awesome job. Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
