##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on Milestone 1. This is going to be a great project, and it will provide plently of opportunity to scale up in the future. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Great work.

###To Do
Only one minor fix... rename the public-html directory to: public_html. Just be mindful of that undescore.

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Great work on Milestone 2. What you have outlined is perfect for the MVP scope. Because you are creating a site that features art, you may be interested in including a gallery plugin such as [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/). It's easy to use and mobile friendly. Does Reb already have a mailing list set up, or would you need to set one up from scratch?

Awesome job. Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 3 Feeback
This is excellent work Tamra, and I love the fact that this is a real client project too. And great work on outlining project specs too.

This layout should be a breeze in Bootstrap. Take a look at the [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) plugin for your gallery. A handful of students have used this in the past with great results, and it's mobile friendly. If you have any questions about implementing this, let me know.

Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier IV. Go ahead and get started on development of your PWP.

## Working On
Rochelle - I'm still having trouble getting the nav bar to work. Do you know of a project that uses the nav bar that you were showing me, so I can take a look at that code?

## Milestone 4 Feedback
You've got a great start, but there's still some work to go. Nice job on the respnsive behavior. If you haven't yet gotten swiftmailer installed, take a look at [Sending Email in PHP](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/php/email/)

### Suggestions
- Take another look at your links in your navbar. It looks like the links in your navbar weren't input right... check the hrefs on your &lt;a&gt; tags. :) 

- Take a look at these two projects for Bootstrap navbar examples:
 
  - https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~rlewis37/bootstrap-sample/
  - https://github.com/rlewis2892/bootstrap-sample


  - https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~rlewis37/bootstrap-sandbox/public_html/
  - https://github.com/rlewis2892/bootstrap-sandbox/tree/karma

- When you deploy to A Small Orange, use CPanel to set the Document Root to your /public_html directory.
